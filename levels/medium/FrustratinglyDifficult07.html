        <h1>ASCII Sokoban: "Frustratingly Difficult" #7</h1>
        
        <p>This level is not actually all that difficult. Actually, <a href="OriginalFrustratinglyDifficult07.html">the first version of this level</a> turned out to be laughably easy, it can be solved with just 28 moves (including 18 pushes). This version is not as easy, it requires at least a hundred moves to solve, but it's still not honestly difficult.</p>
        <p>One of the things that makes it difficult here is that there's no single-move undo. If you've made a mistake, like push a box into a non-goal corner, the only way to recover is to start over by refreshing the page.</p>
