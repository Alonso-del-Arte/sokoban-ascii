# ASCII Sokoban

WORK IN PROGRESS: This is just going to be a quick and dirty ASCII implementation of Sokoban, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'll start with ES5, will probably run into trouble, have to refactor to ES6 and still run into problems. I believe these problems will help clarify certain details in my mind as I set to work on a more structured, object-oriented implementation in Scala.
